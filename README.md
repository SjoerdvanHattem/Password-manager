this is  a password manager i'm making cus i'm really bad with using different passwords and i don't really trust/want to pay for any commercial password managers. 
the program is currently only command line only.
it explains what you need to (badly)
every datafield you enter will be encrypted with a keystream generated from your masterpassword combined with a diversifier that is stored in plaintext.
all your data gets padded to make sure attackers can not know the length of your data

TODO
add a GUI
make sure my tech illitarate friends don't have to manually install dependencies
